## Open Source Code Contributions
- OOIPy - a python package for accessing broadband and low frequency hydrophone data that is part of the Ocean Observatories Innitiative [ [github] ](https://github.com/Ocean-Data-Lab/ooipy) [ [pypi] ](https://pypi.org/project/ooipy/)
- xrsignal (in development)- a python package that ports functionality from scipy.signal to xarray and is compatible with distributed computing [ [github] ](https://github.com/John-Ragland/xrsignal) 

## Cruise Experience
- RC0090 2022, 2 days - deployed mooring with two hydrophones that was successfully recovered one week later. The goal of this deployment was to acoustically measure methane seeps in the Puget Sound.
- RR2411 2024, 21 days - joint operation to measure deep scattering layer, and low-frequency acoustic propagation around seamounts in the North Atlantic.
