In this work, we present a method for measuring the depth-averaged, deep ocean temperature at local (∼3 km) spatial scales using passive estimates of acoustic propagation. These passive acoustic estimates of deep ocean temperature can be used with existing and future passive acoustic monitoring infrastructure to provide complimentary observations of the ocean to in situ measurements, and could be particularly useful in areas of poor ocean observation coverage. Using 8 years of ambient sound data, we demonstrate that the passive estimates agree with global ocean models and measurements by ARGO floats. The rms difference between the HYCOM ocean model is shown to be 0.13°C, and the rms difference between ARGO measurements is shown to be 0.086°C.}, number={12}, journal={Geophysical Research Letters}, author={Ragland, John and Abadi, Shima and Sabra, Karim}, year={2024}, pages={e2024GL108943}, language={en} }

The OOI sensor network has five low frequency (Fs = 200 Hz) and six broadband (Fs = 64 kHz) hydrophones that have been recording ambient sound since 2015. In this paper, we analyze acoustic data from 2015 to 2020 to identify prominent features that are present in the OOI acoustic dataset. Notable features in the acoustic dataset that are highlighted in this paper include volcanic and seismic activity, rain and wind noise, marine mammal vocalizations, and anthropogenic sound, such as shipping noise. For all low frequency hydrophones and four of the six broadband hydrophones, we will present long-term spectrograms, median time-series trends for different spectral bands, and different statistical metrics about the acoustic environment. We find that 6-yr acoustic trends vary, depending on the location of the hydrophone and the spectral band that is observed. Over the course of six years, increases in spectral levels are seen in some locations and spectral bands, while decreases are seen in other locations and spectral bands. Last, we discuss future areas of research to which the OOI dataset lends itself.}, note={Publisher: Acoustical Society of America

The two hydrophones are separated by 3.2 km and are bottom-mounted at 1500 m. We demonstrate the ability of ambient noise interferometry to reliably detect multi-path arrivals in the deep ocean from bottom-mounted hydrophones. An analysis of the multi-path arrival peak emergence is presented, as well as long-term trends of the signal-to-noise ratio of the arrival peaks. Last, we show that long-term ambient noise interferometry provides the opportunity for monitoring directional, coherent ambient sound such as the fin whale chorus.}, note={Publisher: Acoustical Society of America

The airgun shots are used as an approximation of an impulsive sound source at a discrete location, which allows us to investigate spatial contributions to the cross correlation between the two hydrophones. Simulated and experimental results are presented. The contributions to the cross correlations are explained by different reflections off the surface or bottom of the ocean, and a discussion about what can and cannot be inferred about the emergence to the Green’s function is presented.}, note={Publisher: Acoustical Society of America
