The technique utilizes strain rates in a fiber optic cable, observed via the backscatter of light pulses, to measure the acoustic field. Recently, the capabilities of this technology to measure higher frequency acoustic fields (10s to 100s of Hz) have been explored. Low frequency marine mammals calls at ∼20 Hz and ship noises have been successfully recorded, and a recent experiment demonstrated the capability to record up to ∼500 Hz. This talk provides an overview of DAS technology and introduces two recent experiments for studying water column acoustics with DAS. A 4-day experiment conducted in November 2020 as part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) provides data along two fiber optic cables extending west from the coast of Oregon by 65 km and 95 km, reaching depths of 590 m and 1575 m, respectively. DASCAL22, a recent experiment from October 2022, simultaneously recorded data using DAS at 2 kHz sampling rate on a cable extending 3.54km at ∼100 m depth and multiple moored hydrophones placed close to the DAS cable, allowing direct comparison between a new and existing technology.}, note={Citation Key: douglass2023}, booktitle={184th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America}, author={Douglass, Alexander S. and Ragland, John and Abadi, Shima}, year={2023}, month=mar, pages={A64–A64}, language={en} }

The technology can densely sample the acoustic field over long ranges (up to 100 km), providing a means for large scale passive acoustic monitoring. To evaluate the capabilities of DAS, it is necessary to benchmark and calibrate the technology relative to traditional hydrophone data. The DAS Calibration Experiment 2022 (DASCAL22) recorded 9 days of both DAS and hydrophone data in Puget Sound, WA in October 2022. The DAS data were recorded with a sample rate of 2 kHz, and the cable extended 3.5 km on the seafloor between two islands, reaching depths of 100 m, and the hydrophones were moored adjacent to the DAS cable at 5 m and 25 m from the seafloor. The recordings include impulses from an active source at 1 m, 5 m, and 10 m depths, and an abundance of passive acoustic data corresponding to ship traffic, wind, and rain.

Ambient noise interferometry is a well-developed technique in seismic imaging applications, allowing for the measurement of surface wave velocities using microseisms. Ambient noise interferometry has also been used in acoustic oceanography to measure oceanographic variables such as water temperature and flow velocity. Along with measuring the TDGF, ambient noise interferometry can also be used to characterize the directionality of coherent sound in the ocean. In this talk, we use six years of ambient sound data recorded by two bottom mounted hydrophones to investigate ambient noise interferometry in the deep ocean. The hydrophones are separated by 3.2 km and are both at a depth of 1500 m. We show that the TDGF between the two hydrophones can be resolved with averaging times around 200 hours. Additionally, the TDGF contains clear, multi-path arrivals. These multi-path arrivals have not been previously observed with ambient noise interferometry in the deep ocean. We also observe a chorus of fin whale vocalizations originating from near Alaska, that is not visible in data recorded by a single hydrophone. Lastly, the viability of using multi-path arrival times in the deep ocean for passive acoustic tomography will be explored. Multi-path arrival times provide a unique opportunity for ocean observation since they contain information about the entire, deep ocean, water column. We will present ocean acoustic simulations to estimate the expected seasonal fluctuations of the multi-path arrival times due to temperature changes and we will evaluate the viability of using the multi-path peaks measured with ambient noise interferometry for passive acoustic tomography.

We have previously shown that ambient noise interferometry can resolve multi-path arrivals between two bottom-mounted hydrophones separated by 3.2 km, at a depth of 1500 m, and located 470 km off the Oregon coast. In 2019, a seismic reflection survey was conducted directly over the two hydrophones for 28 days covering a 763 km2 area. The airgun shots occurred every 37.5 m while the ship moved at a speed of ∼4.5 knots, equivalent to a shooting interval of 16 s. The hydrophone recordings during this survey provide the unique opportunity to understand the effects of the surface source distribution on the noise cross correlation function (NCCF). In this talk, we show the sensitivity of the NCCF to the surface source locations using simulated and experimental data. Then, we use the image source method to analytically define the location of the sound sources that contribute to different delay times in the NCCF.

This acoustic dataset presents numerous potential areas of study in the field of ambient sound analysis. In this talk, we analysis 6 years of acoustic data to identify prominent features that are present in the OOI acoustic dataset. Some notable occurrences that are observed in the dataset include volcanic activity, rain and wind noise, fin whale vocalizations, and shipping events. For all low frequency hydrophones and four of the six broadband hydrophones, we will present long-term spectrograms, time-series trends for different spectral bands, different acoustic features that are present in the dataset, and different statistical metrics about the acoustic environment. We find that 6-year, acoustic, trends vary depending on the location of the hydrophone and the spectral band that is observed. Some locations and spectral bands see increases in spectral levels while others see decreases in spectral levels over the course of the 6 years.

In this talk, an overview of research and outreach conducted by the Ocean Data Lab at the University of Washington that utilizes this acoustic data will be presented. Some of the research topics that will be presented include trends in ambient sound and using ambient noise interferometry to estimate the Green’s function between two hydrophones. For the trends in ambient sound, data from 9 of the hydrophones over six years is visualized, analyzed, and compared to previous results. Data recorded by two low-frequency hydrophones has successfully been used to estimate the Green’s function between the two hydrophones by measuring the coherence of the ambient sound. Additionally, data of opportunity has been used to experimentally explore the emergence of the Green’s function for bottom mounted hydrophones in the north-east pacific. Lastly, an online, interactive data explorer for the low frequency hydrophones will be presented. This data explorer provides the opportunity for the public to view and explore the low frequency acoustic data measured and provided by the Ocean Observatories Initiative.
